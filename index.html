                    <p>I am a self-taught software engineer passionate about Identity & Access Management, all things DevOps,
                        and delivering features that provide meaningful and useful functionality to clients. I began my career
                        as a Security Access Analyst at a financial services firm. There I expanded the company's nascent
                        roles based acccess control program to other parts of the company to better track current systems
                        access as well as create a reliable and repeatable process for efficiently provisioning access to
                        new employees. As I began using SQL and PowerShell scripts to manage the project more efficiently,
                        I developed the desire to solve problems with software as a career and transitioned to write software
                        full time within the same company. I have since continued to explore this as a passion and career
                        and desire to continue doing so at a growing technology where hard work, high performance, and quality-
                        and customer-driven development consistently define success.</p>

                        <p>I began my career as a Security Access Analyst at a financial services firm. There I expanded the
                            company's nascent roles based acccess control program to other parts of the company to better

                            and transitioned to write software full time within the same company.</p>

                        <p>This role, Security Developer, focused on maintaining and improving the company's Identity and Access
                            Management systems. I delivered a system to replace our Commercial Off The Shelf automated user
                            provisioning system with a system designed and delivered by my team and I. This improved the
                            success rate of our automated provisioning actions from 20% with the COTS product to >95% with
                            the custom system. This system automatically ingested HR events, for example when a new employee
                            was hired, accounts for Active Directory, SQL, trading system, and other accounts were created
                            based on their job responsibilities. The system was comprised of several WCF microservices, MS
                            SQL databases for persistence, and Windows Services written in C# 5.0 for processing batch actions.
                            In the latter half of this project, I was promoted to the technical lead and team lead. I also
                            assumed product owner and scrum master responsibilities in addition to my previous responsibilities.</p>

                    <div class="row panel-body">
                        <p>I have been working for a hosted solutions and managed services provider to deliver customer-facing
                            features in our customer portal. Using C# 5.0 (.NET 4.5.2), Entity Framework, SignalR, Hangfire,
                            and other technologies, I worked as a member of the team and as a technical lead to implement
                            several new systems and features; these included monitoring and alerting on critical metrics
                            on customer devices, firewall policy management, and device patch scheduling and management.
                            As a member of our devops team, I maintained our build and deployment systems. In these roles
                            I have focused on increasing quality of delivered features by expanding and improving our automated
                            testing practices, mentoring and learning from others through code reviews, and improving our
                            manual testing processes with our qa team members.</p>

                        <p>During an internal hackathon I also developed a new system to more quickly and efficiently report
                            outages to our customers. It was comprised of a web ui that allowed operations techs to input
                            text which would be delivered to customers via SMS, voice, email, the company's twitter account,
                            and the company status page. It was deployed as an Azure API application and used Azure Blob
                            storage, Twilio for SMS and voice, and SendGrid for email. The SMS, voice, and email functionality
                            was also added to the monitoring system I had previously worked on.</p>

                        <p>I have explored Docker and Vagrant for configuration-driven local development environments. I also
                            invested time in learning languages outside of the realm of .NET such as Python and the Flask
                            framework. I have explored the Azure cloud and Visual Studio Team Services as alternatives to
                            the internally hosted build and deployment systems that I am accustomed to using at work. As
                            I have focused more efforts on devops related projects at work, I have also been spending time
                            outside of work learning about related technologies to further improve this area of my software
                            skills and knowledge.</p>

                            for a growing software company. I want to work for a company that consistently values quality-
